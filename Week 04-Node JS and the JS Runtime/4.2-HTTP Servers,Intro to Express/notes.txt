1.Port:-In networking,ports are logical endpoints used by protocols to identify specific processes running on a computer or server.
        They help direct network traffic to the correct application or service on a system.

2.Methods:-HTTP methods are used to specify the type of action that the client wants to perform on a resource on the server.
   
Common methods
    a. GET -  Retrieve data from a server. (Get my TODOS)
    b. POST - Submit data to be processed by a server. (Create a TODO)
    c. PUT - Update or create a resource on the server (Update my todo)
    d. DELETE - Remove a resource from the server. (Delete my todo)
 
3.Response:-The response represents what the server returns you `in response` to the request.
    a. Plaintext data - Not used as often
    b. HTML - If it is a website
    c. JSON Data - If you want to fetch some data (user details, list of todos…)

    JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation*. It is a lightweight, text-based format used for data interchange.

4.Status codes:-HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server to indicate the outcome of a client’s request. They provide information about the status of the request and the server's response.

    a.200 series (Success)
         -200 OK: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
        -204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to send in the response

    b.300 series (Redirection)
        -301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL permanently. The client should use the new URL provided in the response.
        -304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request. The client can use the cached version.

    c.400 series (Client Error)
        - 400 Bad Request: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
        - 401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication. The client must provide credentials.
        - 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
        - 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

    d.500 series (Server Error)
        - 500 Internal Server Error: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
        - 502 Bad Gateway: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while acting as a gateway or proxy.    

5.Body:-In HTTP communications, the body (or payload) refers to the part of an HTTP message that contains the actual data being sent to the server.
        It is usually JSON data that is transferred to the server.
        For example - 
        {
        todo: "Go to the gym"
        }
