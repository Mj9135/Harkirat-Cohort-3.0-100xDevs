/*
 * DOM:- Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents.
 * It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects.
 * DOM abstracts the structure of the document into a tree of objects,allowing scripts to manipulate the content and structure dynamically.
 * This abstraction enables more complex interactions and functionalities beyond just static HTML.
